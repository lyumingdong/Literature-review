> - This paper examines international urban systems from the standpoint of international air traffic flows and analyzes the patterns of international air passenger and cargo flows within and among the Asian, European and American regions. After evaluating the international air network structures in 1982 and in 1998, the degree of ‘hub-ness’ for prospective hub cities from 1982 to 1998 is clarified by a basic gravity model composed of GDP, population and distance introducing city-dummy variables. The results reveal that Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam in Europe and New York and Miami in the US are strengthening their positions as international hubs.
